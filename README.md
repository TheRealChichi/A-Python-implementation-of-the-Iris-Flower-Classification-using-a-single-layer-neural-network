"# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a Python implementation of the **Iris Flower Classification** using a simple single-layer neural network with softmax activation and cross-entropy loss.

## Project Overview

The **Iris Flower Dataset** is a famous dataset often used in machine learning examples. The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on the length and width of their petals and sepals.

### Classes
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

The model uses a simple neural network to classify the flowers based on input features.

## Getting Started
